# Computers

We all use computers every day, but can you actually use and maintain them? If you struggle to connect to someone's WiFi, can't tell the difference between the internet and a web browser, or commonly say "I'm bad with computers" then this is for you.

This is a course takes you from "I'm bad with computers" to being able to ensure your computer and data security, troubleshoot your day to day issues, and understand a lot more about how your computer works.

This is currently under development and [the proposed curriculum can be found here](./curriculum-proposal.md).
